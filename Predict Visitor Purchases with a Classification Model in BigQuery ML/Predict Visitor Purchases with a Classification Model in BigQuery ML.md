    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'decent'
    WHEN roc_auc > .6 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model_2,  (

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features

     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630' # eval 2 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
